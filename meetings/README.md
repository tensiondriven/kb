# Meetings History

This directory contains one entry for each meeting which significantly affects governance or operations. Each meeting should have the following structure:

date-topic.md
date-topic/supporting-file

If there are no supporting files, the folder is not needed. The meeting details can be committed to git, and then mined for actions and data, or, if the meeting is performed in real time with the wiki available, it may be that the meeting details are already in the wiki. If possible, link the Meeting Commit to the Gov and Ops commit(s).
