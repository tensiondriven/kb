# Meeeting Log
- type: ad hoc
- purpose: establish initial role and project structure
- attendees:
  - Jonathan (Top of org chart)
  - Kaitlin (Performing all roles for now)

The included is a chat log of a conversation with ChatGPT 5 Advanced Voice Mode which establishes the overall structure of the project.  This will become the initial structure. Any information which does not fit in gov or ops, such as the knowledge graph, must have entries saved in TODO so they can be ingested properly later. These entries can refernce line number ranges in the transcript.md and should be concise but descriptive.

Noteworthy; this transcript has 617 lines, 10891 tokens, and 47740 characters. It is a copy/paste from the ChatGPT web interface directly from html web page, no special formatting.
