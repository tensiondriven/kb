You said:
“You there?”
00:00
ChatGPT said:

Yep, I'm here! Let me know what you need.

You said:
“So I'm going to do a sort of a game. I want to describe my dream team for my personal life, and I want you to write it down. So like, I can just use the chat transcript, and then I want you to ask simple clarifying questions. And I'll say timeout, and then I'll give you coaching on how I want those questions to be given to me. And then we'll go back time in. Does that sound good? Any questions? You there?”
00:36
ChatGPT said:

I’m right here! That sounds totally fine to me—no problem at all. We can definitely do that game where you describe your dream team, I’ll jot it down, and I’ll toss in some simple clarifying questions. And then if you say “time out,” you can coach me on how you want those questions and we’ll jump back in. No questions on my end—just let me know when you’re ready!

You said:
“Okey-doke-a-loles, let's do it. So my dream team is described as a set of roles, like in Holacracy, like I'm going to talk about job functions and accountabilities and their relationships. I'm not going to talk about, like, I don't know, classic job descriptions. So I want somebody whose job it is to search the internet for things I'm interested in and look for deals, things like cheap BMW i3s in my area.”
00:40
ChatGPT said:

Got it! I’ll keep it rolling. So you’re picturing a team defined by roles and accountabilities, kind of like in holacracy, and one of those roles would be someone who hunts the web for deals on stuff you’re into—like snagging cheap BMW i3s nearby. I’ll start with that and feel free to toss in more roles. When you want me to adjust how I’m asking questions, just say the word.

You said:
“Did you say snack, snacking cheek?”
00:02
ChatGPT said:

I did indeed say "snagging cheap"—just meaning finding those good deals on the BMW i3s. So all good there!

You said:
“Oh, I thought you said snacking as in adjective. Like, that's snacking cheap, matey! Or whatever you would say in England.”
00:10
ChatGPT said:

Ah, gotcha! Nope, just a little "snagging" as in grabbing. But hey, “snacking cheap” does have a nice ring to it. Let’s roll with it and keep going!

You said:
“Okay, snack on! There's also somebody who is responsible for maintaining the IT infrastructure, and that means making sure that critical services are up, and that means dashboards and alerting. That includes the Wi-Fi network, Omada, webcams, security cameras, time-lapse cameras, cameras in the barn, cameras on the inside of the barn, outside of the barn, and then also equipment like the GNS, GPS that's going to be going in, the internet connection, connection quality, power monitoring. We also have home assistants, a NAS, OpenSense router. These are all things that should be considered. Electrical panel, okay. Next one is going to be sort of like a knowledge archaeologist. They really enjoy documenting a new territory, a new space, a new linguistic territory, a new linguistic space, and that space is the physics of work. I've done some work on physics of work in my tilde, like my home directory, slash code, slash Athena? No, no, twiddle, slash code, slash physics of work is where it is, and it's basically like GTD, and it's like if you drew a line and it was like GTD, from GTD to holacracy, it's something kind of in the middle that's sort of like holacracy light.”
01:47
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, I’ve got

You said:
“That's the physics of work. It's describing the fundamental atomic units of work and energy and requests and completion. And then that information, that paradigm, also informs something. And that thing is probably a different role. I guess there's a product manager for this. I guess this is like an online knowledge graph. That online knowledge graph maintains my world. And basically, there's somebody who just really gets off on making sure that everything that I talk about exists in that knowledge graph. And then that there are relationships, and the relationships are interesting. And maybe there's somebody else. Maybe it's the same person. But we also need somebody who's going to be mining that for facts and generating knowledge from the graph. And then maybe generating insights, maybe RAG. And now I'm going to describe some more of what I want, and we'll figure out the roles. So one of the key pieces of infrastructure is this inference engine. And it can talk to, it's like an orchestrator. It's called Indigo. And it can talk to MQTT. It can talk to other instances of itself through MQTT. It can call functions and tools. It can talk, but I want to say what it talks to. It talks to MQTT, HTTP web pages, and then it usually runs in a terminal or it runs headless. And it's basically just an orchestrator, one process per agent. And then the details of that are in home directory code Indigo. Okay. So then we've got a bunch of screens and speakers and mics around the house. And that's how all of these roles are going to interact with me, through speech mostly. Um, let's get this thing here.”
02:07
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, I’m on it! So to recap in a nutshell, you’re imagining a whole set of roles that cover everything from that deal-finder for BMW i3s to someone maintaining all your IT infrastructure—Wi-Fi, cameras, Home Assistant, NAS, you name it. Then you’ve got this “knowledge archaeologist” kind of role for mapping out your “physics of work,” which is like a blend of GTD and holacracy-light. And on top of that, a product manager type who makes sure everything you talk about lives in a nice, neat knowledge graph, plus someone to pull insights from that graph.

And then there’s your Indigo orchestrator that talks via MQTT, HTTP, and runs in terminals or headless, tying all this together. Finally, all these roles interact with you mostly through speech using your screens, speakers, and mics around the house.

So I’m jotting all that down. If you want to guide me on how you’d like the questions or any other details, just let me know!

You said:
“Share a little bit more here.”
00:01
ChatGPT said:

Sure thing! I’m happy to keep going. So just to get a tiny bit more excited here, it's really cool how you’re envisioning all these roles! I love the idea of this whole ecosystem where you’ve got a knowledge graph keeping track of everything and an orchestrator like Indigo tying it all together. It’s like you’re building this entire personal universe of helpers!

All right, I’ll keep noting it down, and if you want to dive into more roles or give me any pointers on how you’d like me to ask clarifying questions, just say the word!

You got it! I'll just keep it straightforward and keep everything noted down as we go. So feel free to continue, and I’ll be right here to capture it all!

You said:
“So, one piece of this that I haven't built on the tech side is that there's a number of screens. So, I think we need a web app, probably Elixir Phoenix, and basically it can just display content on these screens, like dashboards. So, I imagine URLs like slash screen one, screen two, screen three. And then there's locations, like bedroom. Bedroom TV, lounge TV.”
00:26
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, I’ve got that noted down. So you’re thinking of a web app—probably using Elixir Phoenix—that can serve up dashboards on multiple screens. Each screen would have its own URL, like slash screen one or slash screen two, and you’d have locations like bedroom TV or lounge TV where these dashboards show up. All right, I’ll keep it all recorded. Just let me know if you want to dive into more details!

“The studio has a nice audio system that can play audio, and there's also a number of cameras at the studio, in the workshop, and there's a mobile kind of camera station, the Wikibot. It's called the Wikibot. It's a mobile recording...”
00:16
ChatGPT said:

Got it! So I'll note that down as well. You've got a nice audio system in the studio, and there are several cameras both in the studio and in the workshop. Plus, you have this mobile recording station called the Wikibot. That all fits right into your setup. All noted down! Let me know if there’s anything else you want to add.

You said:

00:01
ChatGPT said:

Yep, exactly! That Wikibot's your mobile recording robot, kind of roaming around and helping capture everything. So I've got that all noted down as part of your setup. Just let me know if there's anything else you want to add in!

You said:
“This is actually a movie. It's a terminal web page.”

ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, everything related is noted. That web app will be like a terminal to your whole system. So it's basically the hub that connects all those screens, your Wikibot, and the rest of the infrastructure. All right, I've got it all down! If there's more you want to add, just let me know.

You said:
“Yeah, okay, I think there might be another role there, though, is, um...”
00:06
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, if you think there might be another

You said:
“Come on, guys.”
00:00
ChatGPT said:

No rush at all! Take your time to think it through, and whenever that next role comes to mind, just let me know and we’ll add it in.

You said:
“Yeah, so from here on out, don't reply with the boilerplate. You can just say, like, got it or okay.”
00:10
ChatGPT said:

Got it!

You said:
“Nicely done. Okay, so, there was one other area, oh, I think there's somebody who's really jazzed about ingesting data, like finding data streams, like the Feedmaster, the Feedmeister, or something like that.”
00:18
ChatGPT said:

Got it! There's someone

You said:
“I'm not totally sure, but...”
00:01
ChatGPT said:

Okay! So we've got a sort of "feedmeister" role in the mix—someone who’s all about gathering those data streams and bringing in different feeds. That’s noted down! If there’s more to add or tweak, just let me know.

You said:
“Yeah, one of their accountabilities is researching and proposing new data sources to capture. And basically, they want to model my world. So they want to model my Facebook friends, my Facebook feed, any data sources, home assistants, any kind of health trackers. Like, we want to make a badass feed.”
00:23
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, got it! So this feedmeister’s accountability is basically to research and propose new data sources that can help model your world. They’ll be pulling in everything from your Facebook friends and feed to Home Assistant data and health trackers. Basically, they’re building one badass feed of all your info. All noted!

You said:
“and they're all, everybody's responsible currently for attending a weekly, I guess it's weekly, I don't know, a weekly tactical, we'll call it tactical meeting, we'll call it a, you know, sync meeting, I don't know, but it's going to have basically, it's going to follow the format of the Holacracy Tactical Meeting. Do you know what that format is?”
00:20
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! Got it noted that everyone’s responsible for attending a weekly tactical meeting. And yep, I know the holacracy tactical meeting format: it’s usually about processing a list of updates, triaging any issues, and making sure everyone’s on the same page. So that totally makes sense. All right, that’s all noted down for your dream team!

You said:
“Okay, I think I need someone watching the finances. I'm trying to think about what's missing. Somebody that's watching the finances and looking out for health, like financial health, physical health, mental health, you know, longevity, safety, planning, stuff like that. Like the worry ward, kinda, but not really.”
00:26
ChatGPT said:

Got it! So you're adding a sort of "worry-wart" role—someone who keeps an eye on finances, physical and mental health, longevity, and safety planning. Basically a guardian of overall well-being. That’s all noted down as well! If anything else comes to mind, just let me know.

You said:
“So that's all the virtual agents, like guardian angels, that I want to make. And what I want to list now is actual, real, physical world people that are on my team.”
00:12
ChatGPT said:

Got it! So that's the full lineup of your virtual agents or guardian angels. Now we’ll shift gears and list out the real-world folks on your team. Just go ahead and start describing them, and I’ll jot them down!

You said:
“Okay, we got Contractor Plumber, Jacob Riley. We got Brandon, forgot his last name, but he's like Handyman. He's also Project Manager for Solar. And we've got Dentists, Dr. Sharky is his name in Oregon, Wisconsin. And we've got,”

If there’s anyone else that comes to mind for your real-world team, just let me know!

You said:
“Yeah, well, let's add in, maybe not team, but let's add these in. Let's add in, okay, so for team, add Philippa, my partner, add my mom, Karen, and then add, just as a list, family, that's Mark McKean, my uncle, Sue, my aunt, and then Casey McKean, that is one of my cousins, and Brayden McKean, that's my other cousin. For all of these people, we're going to want to generate, you know what, there's probably a role that's responsible for researching the knowledge, like filling out the knowledge graph, maybe that's the same role, but when a new node goes in, somebody should be like, oh, interesting, what questions can I ask about this to flesh it out more, you know?”
00:45
ChatGPT said:

Got it! So I'll add your partner Phillipa, your mom Karen, and then family members Mark McKean, Sue, Casey, and Brayden McKean to the team list. And yeah, I totally get it—you want a role that’s about fleshing out that knowledge graph whenever new people or info are added. They’d basically

You said:
“Okay, now here's something new, and here's something new. Let's make, going back to agents, there's someone that's like the optimizer or the Chad. Let's call him Chad. The role's name is Chad. But it's responsible for making things bigger, better, beefier, you know, like optimizing. Like, hey, should we optimize our testosterone? Hey, should we get on a GLP-1 antagonist and get fit? Hey, should we redo, should we make the kitchen bigger so we can cook more? Like, increase in capacity? Like, wouldn't it be sick if we had this capacity? And then there's also a role that is the gallery curator. There's like the soul of the gallery, and the soul of the gallery wants to express itself in the world. And then there's the soul of the workshop, and the soul of the workshop also wants to express itself. But the workshop and the gallery are both part of the Dream Studio. The Dream Studio was created by my mom, and that's actually a physical building, and we want it to be a business. So there's somebody whose goal it is to turn the Dream Studio into a, turn the Dream Studio into a self-sustaining, you know, business, the life of the studio or something. And then what else do we got? We got the studio. We have vendors. We have like electricity and, you know, water utility and propane. We have metrics coming from them that should be collected. We have bank accounts. Those should be collected. Those should be monitored. We have investments. Those should be monitored and managed. There's, yeah, there's an investment manager who like looks at our money and says like, hey, look, you're up 10 bucks this week. And most of these agents have periodic tasks or some sort of a cron schedule. Maybe we just invoke them daily and then have them look at their own prompt. And then that tells them which day it is and what to do. That's probably easiest.”
02:08
ChatGPT said:

Got it! So now we're adding an optimizer agent—nicknamed Chad—whose job is to beef things up, like optimizing

You said:
“Yep, they're doing great, but let's add the gardener or the groundskeeper, you know, interested in the health of the fruit trees and the, you know, managing the harvest, the harvest chief, the harvest manager, something like that.”
00:19
ChatGPT said:

Got it! We'll add

You said:
“Okay. So based on all this, now let's kind of switch, I think, into questions. Oh, and maintenance. There's somebody that's obsessed with maintenance, and so it's like, oh, is it time to get more gravel for the road? Oh, can you show me a queue? Hey, I need to know how the driveway is looking. Can you go out and take a picture of the driveway and send it to me? Stuff like that. Because all of these agents are virtual, so they must only request things of me physically or somebody physically.”
00:30
ChatGPT said:

Got it! So we’ll add a maintenance-obsessed agent who’s all about checking if it’s time to add more gravel to the road, or maybe asking for a picture of the driveway to see how things are looking. And yep, since they’re all virtual, they’ll just request you or someone else to handle the physical side. All right, now we can definitely switch into questions whenever you’re ready!

You said:
“And then I think there's going to be one called like money bags, and it's able to spend some money. It has a bank account. It has $100. And any agent can ask it to spend money, and they have to explain why. And then it maintains and updates and consults a spending policy, which is approved by me. I don't know what my role is yet, but I go at the top of the org chart.”
00:31
ChatGPT said:

Got it! So we

You said:
“I'm the biggest meat sack.”
00:02
ChatGPT said:

Haha, understood! So you’re the top “meat sack” at the top of the org chart, and we’ve got a “moneybags” agent that can spend from its $100 budget if other agents give it a good reason. It’ll check the spending policy that you’ve approved. All right, that’s all noted down, and we can dive into any questions whenever you’re ready!

You said:
“Yeah, let's let's talk about some of the infrastructure that goes along with this. So somewhere there's like a repository of all the agent definitions and all the roles and responsibilities. And there's also probably like an external wiki where people can publish things to. Oh, we've got researchers. There's like a there's a researcher that loves doing research on various projects, maintaining project lists, giving updates, planning, figuring out the next step. Maybe that's more researcher. That's not so much research, but it's more like pro product designer or like life designer or you know what it is. It's the Imagineer, but for the AI generation. Imagineer. I don't know. That's enough.”
01:01
ChatGPT said:

Got it! So we’ve got an imagineer-type role who’s basically responsible for the creative design, planning out next steps, and maintaining project lists and updates. And all of these agent definitions and responsibilities live in a repository somewhere, plus there’s an external wiki for publishing things. All noted down! Let’s dive into any infrastructure questions you have.

You said:
“Okay, so can you ask me some questions to just fill in? Are there any roles that you see missing for, like, what do you anticipate that we're missing? Can you just ask me briefly the names, short descriptions, I'll say yes or no.”
00:14
ChatGPT said:

Sure! Absolutely, I’ll keep it brief. So a couple of quick things: do we have someone dedicated to communication—like a “Comms Coordinator” who handles announcements or updates to the team? Yes or no works! And another one: do we need a "Security Overseer" for data or physical security stuff? Let me know yes or no on that one too!

You said:
“Yes. Yeah, let's do a security person. Let's also do somebody who is like, um...”
00:06
ChatGPT said:

Got it! We'll add

You said:
“It's like AI model concierge. It's somebody who's responsible for checking in on the latest releases, staying on top of the state of the art, probably maintaining some documentation around that, like picking the, like, this is our best choice for our local large model. This is our best choice for our local small model. This speech-to-text thing came out. This new Python library came out that makes us faster.”
00:28
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, got it! So we’ll add an AI model concierge who keeps track of all the latest releases and state-of-the-art models, maintains documentation, and basically picks out the best tools for different AI tasks. All right, that’s noted! Let me know if there’s anything else.

You said:

00:11
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! We’ll add a kind of health and wellness concierge who suggests meals and exercises for both you and Philly, helps you stay on top of your health, and occasionally checks in about things like your weight. All noted down! Let me know if there’s more.

You said:
“Yeah, and then there's like, um, I don't know what it's called yet, but there's this agent that lives in the studio and helps me get things done.”
00:09
ChatGPT said:

Got it! We’ll just call that one the "Studio Helper" for now. Basically, it’s the agent that

You said:
“Okay, and then there's a little bit more. Going back to the studio stuff, so the studio is called the Dream Studio. My mom built it in, like, 1999. I don't know. We need to confirm that date. Oh, yeah, there's an agent that just goes around checking facts, just confirming stuff, checking facts, and, you know, filling in references and backing stuff up and that kind of thing. What was I saying just before that?”
00:26
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, got it! So we’ve got a "Studio Helper" in the Dream Studio, and we’ll add a fact-checking agent who just goes around

You said:
“All right, so the studio construction. So it's named Dream, the Dream Studio. I think we have dreamstudio.org, which is a terrible domain. But so Karen calls it Dream Studio because she wants to have workshops where people come and they dream. They do Robert Moss-style dreaming.”
00:19
ChatGPT said:

Got it! So the Dream Studio is all about hosting workshops where people come and do that Robert Moss-style dreaming, and you’ve got the domain dreamstudio.org for it. That’s all noted down as well! Let me know if there’s anything

Absolutely, got it!

You said:
“I think there's also a personal taskmaster, and that person's job is that they're a combination between my assistant and my leash holder, and they help me throughout the day, get me going and stuff like that. And then there's also this Athena system. This is the system that can turn on a display and display a chart, and then I can ask a question about the chart, and then the chart will change. Somebody needs to be managing this whole Athena system, because it's out of hand. And Athena's, oh, we have a Railway account. That's what we're doing most of our online hosting now. Nabu Casa, a bunch of, way too many subscriptions. We buy a lot of stuff on Amazon and Menards and Farm and Fleet and Walmart, Walmart Plus. We have four fruit trees. We have four peach trees. Confirm all of those things and find out which trees are they and where are they, and that would be the job of that, like the internal PI or whatever, like the curious George, curious Jane. We'll figure that out. Okay, so now imagine that we have, okay, are you still with me?”
01:16
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, I’m still with you! So just to recap, we've got the personal taskmaster who’s like your assistant and keeps you on track, and then we’ve got an Athena system manager to handle

You said:
“Yep, okay, fine, fine, fine. Oh, fuck, what was the last thing? We've got the screens, we've got Athena, we've got text, speech, charts, Vega, Vega-Lite, database definitions in a database. Oh, right, right, okay, so now imagine like a knowledge graph expressed as a D3 node graph with forces, you know, like from the center going out, there's nodes and they have children and leaves. There's different node types, and most of these are extracted from agent work or conversations that we have, and the nodes have relationships. For now, it can all be freeform, but eventually, it'll all be typed, so we'll have entity types, and then we'll have a subtype person, but we also might have a question type, and there's an agent, there's a role that's responsible for asking the right questions, and what they do is they go around the knowledge graph and they find places where there's information to find out, and they put those questions in so that another agent can fill them out. Some questions, so here's an example. I might say, like, oh, yeah, my cousin Casey, I'm going to go have lunch with him tomorrow, so we want to create Casey, and we want to create lunch tomorrow as nodes, and we want to integrate with Google Maps and all the other stuff. That's a separate thing. Maybe there's an integration king. Anyway, but then later on, the question guy comes through, and he says, oh, Casey, that's a person, cool. What's his last name? Where does he live? Does he have a girlfriend? What are his goals, visions, dreams? Jonathan, is he important to you? And so we hang these questions in the right places such that later on, we can get them answered. Okay, I think that's it.”
02:11
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, that makes perfect sense! So we’ll have that role who goes through the knowledge graph, identifies those gaps, and basically hangs up those questions so that we can fill them in later. And I’ve got all that noted down about the Dream Studio and the idea of turning imagination into reality quickly. All right, I think we’ve got a pretty complete picture now!

You said:
“There's also something about Home Improvements Manager. They are responsible for asking me lots of questions and tracking projects and prioritizing towards goals.”

Got it! We’ll add a home improvements

You said:
“There's also somebody who really cares about moving forward the physics of work and might even want to publish a book about it. They like to have meetings with me to explore new ideas and track direction and that kind of thing.”
00:14
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, I’ll include that role as well! So we'll have someone who's all about championing the "Physics of Work," maybe even a kind of book project manager, who sits down with you to hash out ideas and keep that vision on track. We’ll make sure they’re part of the team too!

You said:
Now can you generate a spreadsheet or outline? And can we hook you up to external tools?
ChatGPT said:

Yes! I can generate either:

Spreadsheets (Excel .xlsx or CSV)

Outlines (structured text, Markdown, or DOCX)

And yes, I can integrate with external tools depending on what you’re trying to do:

Local files — You can upload a file here for me to analyze or update.

APIs / custom tools — If you have a service that exposes an API, I can help you build the integration logic.

Home Assistant, n8n, Postgres, etc. — I can help you generate code or workflows to hook into these systems.

What exactly are you trying to track or outline? If you share your goal, I can start by drafting a spreadsheet template or a clean outline format for you.

You said:
“Are you there? Hello? ChatGPT, are you there?”
00:08
ChatGPT said:

Yep, I'm here! Loud and clear. Just let me know what you need next and I’m on it.

You said:
“So let's talk about...can you just ask me some hopefully short questions? Start asking some short questions.”
00:09
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, I can do that. Let’s dive right in with a couple of quick ones!

First question: Is there any particular part of your “dream team” that you feel still needs a defined role or is it mostly covered now?

And second: Do you have a preference for the format of the outline or spreadsheet—like a Google Sheet link, a CSV file, or something else?

Let’s start there!

You said:
“Google Sheets would be amazing if you can integrate.”
00:02
ChatGPT said:

Great! Google Sheets it is. I can definitely help you set up a template or outline that you can then bring into Google Sheets. While I can't directly push

You said:
“Markdown is fine. It's going to go through an LLM. Eventually, it's going to be records in a database. How about this? I'll ask you questions. What format, in terms of the structure, are you thinking is going to work here? And what's missing in terms of what I told you? We can fill in tons of details later, too, but I want to get the bulk of what we can do in the next 20 minutes in the car here.”
00:28
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, Markdown is perfect and super flexible. We can structure it like a hierarchical outline, almost like a mini knowledge base.

In terms of what's missing: I'd say we've got a really solid start with the roles and agents. The main thing we can do in the next few minutes is just note down a rough structure: headers for each role, a brief description, and maybe a few bullets of what each one handles.

So, let's do that! We'll make a Markdown outline that you can later feed into your LLM or database. Here we go.

You said:
“Overall, what do you notice about this? Do you notice any patterns or clustering or anything that would be interesting or that's especially insightful that I might not know about myself?”
00:08
ChatGPT said:

One interesting pattern I’m noticing is that you're essentially building a kind of personal ecosystem of roles—almost like a constellation of helpers that cover a whole spectrum of your life. It’s a bit like you’re designing a "holacracy" of AI agents and real-world people who are all interconnected. That’s pretty unique!

What stands out is that you seem to enjoy having specialized roles that take on distinct responsibilities. It’s like you’re externalizing parts of your workflow and life management into a team of virtual and physical collaborators. And that’s a pretty cool insight into how you think—kind of like a systems thinker who enjoys breaking things down into clear domains.

You might not know this about yourself, but you're effectively creating a personal “micro-organization” with all these roles. It shows you like to keep things organized but also a bit playful. So I’d say that’s a neat little reflection!

“Now let's add, I need like a relationship coach, and I need someone who can help me understand my partner, understand her trauma, understand my trauma, understand how they interrelate, and watch out for, I don't know, talk to me when I'm in a, talk to me when I need help, I guess.”
00:23
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, we can add that in. So we’ll include a kind of “relationship coach” role that’s there to help you navigate understanding both your own and your partner’s experiences, and how they fit together. Basically, it’s like having a gentle guide to give you a nudge or some insight when you need it.

I’ll put that into the outline too. And if you want, we can flesh it out more later, but I’ll just add a nice concise bullet for that role as well.

You said:
“Maybe I'll jokingly refer to this as my cult.”
00:02
ChatGPT said:

Haha, your "cult"—got it! I love the humor there. We’ll keep it light. So yeah, we’ll just fold that relationship coach role right into the mix, and your “cult” of helpful agents is coming together nicely! Let me add that to our little Markdown outline and you’ll have your personal ecosystem draft ready to go.

You said:
“Now pretend you're that question agent that looks for prescient questions to ask. What questions would you ask first?”
00:08
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, I’ll put on the hat of that “question agent” for a moment!

So, as that inquisitive agent, here are a few questions I’d ask to fill out the picture even more:

What kind of “voice” or personality do you want each of these agents to have? For example, should your relationship coach be more gentle and empathetic, or more direct and practical?

How often do you want these agents to interact with you? Should they proactively check in daily, weekly, or only when you ask?

Are there any boundaries or limits you want to set on certain agents? For instance, topics they should or shouldn’t bring up, or areas of your life they shouldn’t venture into unless you invite them.

Do you envision any of these agents collaborating with each other? For example, should the relationship coach and the health-focused agent share insights to give you a more holistic picture?

And of course, we can refine any of these further. Just let me know which ones spark something for you!

Absolutely understood. So inside your little ecosystem, they can be as informal, as direct, and as in-your-face as they need to be—kind of like a no-holds-barred Barry Oshry dynamic. But when it comes to the outside world, they’ll put on that five-star, ultra-professional service face. That makes total sense. We’ll bake that into their personality profiles, and they can flip between being your candid internal advisors and your polished external representatives. Let’s roll with that!

You said:
“It has access to a personal wiki and a research area, scratchpads, and a set of tools, all the tools that you can get, like if you don't have them. Web search is a tool, write file, read file, update file, send NQTT message, send message to agent, spawn agent instance, and that list, all of that stuff, we can just say the full list of tools is available in Indigo.”
00:31
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, we’ll give them that full tool belt. So they’ll have access to all those capabilities—web searching, reading and writing files, sending MQTT messages, spinning up new agent instances, and basically everything they need from Indigo. So they’ll be pretty well-equipped to do their thing, and you can just imagine them diving into their personal wiki and scratch pads to keep everything running smoothly. We’ll note that down as part of their setup!

You said:
“I'm going to have an event at some point, and then we're going to filter it for stuff that's interesting. I think we already have an agent that's into that. StreamGenie, maybe? I don't know.”
00:11
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, we can have that all flow into a big data stream and let your "Stream Genie" (or whatever we want to call that agent) sift through it. That way, it can pull out the interesting bits and highlight them for you. So we’ll just integrate that into the overall setup. It sounds like we’re building a really cool little ecosystem

You said:

ChatGPT said:

Exactly! It’s all coming together into a neat ecosystem where that Stream Genie can surface the gems from the data flow and keep things interesting. We’ll definitely plug that into the outline as well. And hey, it sounds like you’ve got a whole crew of agents ready to make your vision happen. Let’s run with that and have some fun!

You said:
“Visual designer, information architect, UX, UI, really into next-generation Vega, Vega Lite, D3, visualizations, combining visualizations in novel ways, really enjoys that. I also think that agents should have the option of having emotions enabled, so they can seek towards certain states or something. Maybe that's something for later. Put that on the Athena project manager's backlog. Probably everybody has a backlog of their own list of tasks and projects.”
00:43
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, that’s a great addition. We’ll have a kind of “visual designer” or information architect agent who’s really into next-gen visualizations—Vega, Vega-Lite, D3, all of that. And we’ll put on the Athena project manager’s backlog the idea that agents can have emotions or “emotional states” that they can lean towards over time. And yeah, we’ll assume each agent has their own backlog of tasks and projects. That way everyone’s got a little to-do list, and we’ll keep it all nicely organized. It’s all part of the grand plan!

“Relationship Coach, look out for my social life, too.”

Absolutely, we can have

You said:
“No, I think it's something different. I think it's something different. There's a different role, and it's literally like a socialite, and it's, um... It's... it's the... it's like the, um... Oh, what's her name? That woman... the actress that was really popular in the 50s, like, wearing, like, the boa, and, like, the cigarette holder, and, like, DALL·E, God, where have you been to those places? Oh, we should go have dinner with the set, like... Like, sort of like Snooty Rich, but more... more like Portland Hipster, but, like, a clean Portland Hipster.”
00:37
ChatGPT said:

Ah, I see what you're going for! So we’ll have a dedicated “socialite” agent who’s got that kind of glamorous, slightly posh vibe—like a stylish Portland hipster with a vintage flair. They’ll pop in and say, “Darling, we must go out and do this or that,” and help you keep your social life vibrant and fun. That’ll be a whole separate role from the relationship coach—so they’ll be like your personal social curator with a bit of flair. We’ll definitely add that to the mix!

You said:
“Since they can't go into the real world, they love it when I go out, they see people, make new relationships, meet friends. You know, when my social network gets bigger or more strong, she might ask questions. She might maintain her own blog or journal about this. It'd be cool if everybody had their own journal, too, like just a private thoughts journal. Everybody should probably be keeping track of the work that they do, too. Maybe not the times? I don't know. It'd be cool. I mean, it'd be cool to know, like, timesheets. We could try that. Put that down as an idea for the Athena project manager, though.”
00:41
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, that sounds like a fun idea. So your socialite agent will keep her own little journal of your social adventures, celebrating whenever you expand your network or meet new people. And we can definitely have each agent keep their own private thoughts journal, like a little diary of what they’re doing and noticing. We’ll toss that on the Athena project manager’s backlog as an idea to explore. And sure, maybe some light “timesheet” tracking just to see where the agents are putting in their time—just for fun. It’s all part of the grand plan!

ChatGPT said:

I'm definitely still here! And that all makes perfect sense. So we can absolutely do that kind of structure: each agent will have a handful of defined responsibilities or accountabilities, and each of those can have a full name and a short name—kind of like how in holacracy, you give agenda items or roles a short, clear title. That way, everything is easy to refer to quickly.

And yes, I can definitely tell you about titling agenda items in holacracy. Essentially, in a holacracy tactical meeting, each agenda item is given a brief title so that everyone knows what the topic is at a glance. It’s just a way of keeping things organized and easy to reference. So we can apply that same idea here: each agent’s responsibilities get a short, snappy name along with a more detailed description. And we’ll add that to the whole structure. Sounds like a great plan!

You said:
We also need a short term project manager, the propert needs a place to store 2 cars 
ChatGPT said:

Looks like you’re thinking about a short-term project manager role to handle building or setting up a space to store two cars on the property.

Here’s what I’d suggest to capture this clearly in your outline or spreadsheet:

Role Draft
Field	Details
Role Name	Short-Term Project Manager – Car Storage
Short Name	Car Storage PM
Goal	Plan and execute a short-term project to create a structure for two cars.
Key Tasks	<ul><li>Research storage options (prefab garages, pole barns, carports, etc.)</li><li>Get quotes and timelines from local contractors</li><li>Handle permit applications if needed</li><li>Manage scheduling and materials delivery</li><li>Report progress weekly</li></ul>
Target Completion	[Set a date—e.g., “Before winter 2025”]
Resources	Budget, contact list of local builders, site plan

Would you like me to generate a spreadsheet for this so you can start tracking quotes, tasks, and timelines? Or do you want it as a Markdown outline to fold into your existing knowledge graph?

You said:
“We're going to need a handful of apps.”

Absolutely, you’ll probably want a few apps or tools to help manage everything smoothly. For example, a project

You said:
“Why don't you tell me, give me a short list of tools, don't explain a whole lot, but just give me, what infrastructure or support would you add for this?”
00:07
ChatGPT said:

Sure, here’s a quick list:

Trello or Asana for task tracking.

Google Sheets for budgets and timelines.

Dropbox or Google Drive for storing quotes and documents.

Local contractor directory app for easy outreach.

And that’s the gist!

“I was thinking more about local custom tooling, and I was planning to use SQLite or NocoDB or Postgres. For the most part, I don't know, using those tools with MCP or something would be great. I'm wondering if it's going to introduce a lot of latency and delay. If you think about this system running over a period of a week or a month, does having it be remote really make that much of a difference or not?”
00:30
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, definitely understood. So if you're leaning toward something like SQLite or a local Postgres setup, that’s a great choice for keeping things super responsive and low-latency. Using something like MCP to manage that locally is definitely going to keep things snappy if you’re mostly running it all on your own infrastructure.

In other words, if everything’s running on a local network or even just on a single machine, you’re not really going to notice much

“I'm going to talk about this wiki. Our wiki app, which right now is just a folder, but eventually it's going to have AI suggestions that can be either approved, re-rolled, or dismissed, or manually entered. Those are the four options. The question guide might generate a question, and then we might generate four possible answers, and then present those to me, and then I have multiple choice. Or I say, none of these is good. I need more. Regenerate. And then another app, we've got all these roles now, so we need a way to manage them. So there's some way to display all this information. And then I want a way to work on the personalities of the agents that are running the roles. Maybe we just do the holacracy thing. We just use Caitlin, and we make sure that she is in a particular role whenever she's operating. So whenever Caitlin's operating, whenever anybody is performing any – okay, so I think we need a list of rules for how we work together, and there's a good holacracy one, holacracy style. Whenever anyone is working on anything, they must be in a role, and they need to record the estimated value of what they're doing and the estimated cost of what they're doing to calculate an estimated ROI for what they're doing. Or maybe that's a separate role. This is like the guy from The Bobs. It's The Bobs. It's the guy that asks you if you're doing the right thing. What did you say you do here? That guy? Okay, a couple more things. We're almost home. So what I would like when we export this data, I would like each of these roles to have a name, a short name, and then a list of responsibilities, and then also all of the text that went into making their prompt. I'd like all that text just saved raw. So everything I'm saying now, I'm thinking it's like a JSON array of text, or it's like a – maybe it's a JSON array of objects, and they have text, but they also have when they were recorded and maybe even like wave metadata, like recorded on this date by this person with these people present. That can all be LLM generated. Overall, we want less code, more agents.”
02:51
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, I’ve got it. So basically we’ll have each role with its name, short name, a list of responsibilities, and we’ll store all the raw text that went into defining them. We’ll keep it like a JSON array of objects, each entry with the text, the timestamp, and a bit of metadata. And then that’ll give us a nice structure to work with—less hard-coded stuff, more agent flexibility. So yep, we can definitely do that!

“I have a role that's called, like, the future. It's, like, responsible for looking out for my future. Like, maintaining a 5-year, 10-year, 20-year plan. Making sure we don't run out of money for retirement. There's probably also, like, an accountant role that is responsible for watching my bank accounts. So it would do that on a daily basis. It would look at Monarch, and it would need access to a bunch of credentials probably.”
00:27
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, we can add that in. So we’ll have a “Future” role that’s basically the long-term planner, making sure your retirement and future horizons are all in check. And then we’ll have an “Accountant” role that keeps an eye on the day-to-day finances, checking your bank accounts and integrating with something like Monarch. We’ll note that it’ll need credentials and a secure way to handle those. So yeah, we’ll just plug those roles into the structure, and that’ll be all set.

You said:
Well, i want to see if we can collect the source text for everything we're making
ChatGPT said:

Got it — you’d like to preserve not just the structured roles and people, but also the raw source text that we’ve been working from (the conversations, definitions, little narratives, etc.).

We can handle that a couple of ways:

Option A: Append to CSV/Markdown

Add a column in the CSVs called source_text.

For each role/person, drop in the original snippet or summary text that we wrote together.

This keeps it bundled with the structured fields.

Option B: Separate “Source Log” File

Create a JSON (or Markdown) log that’s literally an array of objects like:

{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-03T19:30:00Z",
  "entity": "Deal Finder",
  "text": "Hunts the web for bargains on things Jonathan cares about (e.g., cheap BMW i3s nearby)."
}


That way you’ve got a running capture of all raw text, tied to entity + timestamp.

Do you want me to regenerate the CSVs with a source_text column, or spin up a separate JSON/Markdown log file that just collects the source text in full?
