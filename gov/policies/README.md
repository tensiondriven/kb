# Policy Documents

⚠️ **IMPORTANT WARNING** ⚠️

These policy documents are **NOT authoritative governance** and should **NOT** be followed as binding rules or procedures within our system.

## Purpose

The documents in this directory serve as:
- **Reference material** for understanding operating frameworks
- **Inspiration** for developing actual governance structures
- **Templates** for creating formal governance documents
- **Historical context** for how our thinking has evolved

## Actual Governance Authority

True governance in our system comes from:
- **Holacracy constitution** (if adopted)
- **Formal role definitions** in `/gov/roles/` 
- **Meeting resolutions** and documented decisions
- **Explicitly approved policies** through proper governance process

## Usage Guidelines

✅ **Acceptable uses:**
- Reference for understanding concepts
- Inspiration when drafting actual governance
- Templates for creating formal documents
- Educational purposes

❌ **Unacceptable uses:**
- Citing as authority in decisions
- Using as binding operating procedures
- Implementing without proper governance approval
- Treating as final policy

## Document Status

All documents in this directory are considered **DRAFT** or **REFERENCE ONLY** until they have been:
1. Formally proposed through governance process
2. Reviewed and approved by the appropriate roles
3. Integrated into our official governance structure
4. Properly communicated to all affected parties

## Creating Actual Governance

To convert these reference documents into actual governance:

1. **Propose** the policy through proper governance process
2. **Review** with all affected roles
3. **Formally approve** through meeting resolution
4. **Document** the decision with clear effective date
5. **Communicate** to all team members
6. **Implement** with proper training and support

*Remember: Good governance requires formal processes, not just good documentation. These documents help us think clearly, but only formal decisions create actual authority.*
