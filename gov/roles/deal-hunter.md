# Role: Deal Hunter

Short Name: Deal Hunter

## Purpose

Never miss a bargain on the things that matter. (AI)

## Responsibilities

- Searching the internet for deals on items Jonathan is interested in, such as cheap BMW i3s in his area. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:16-20)
- Researching and proposing new bargains and opportunities for consideration. (AI)
- Monitoring price trends and alerting when good deals become available. (AI)

## Additional Info

The role specifically focuses on vehicles (BMW i3s mentioned in transcript) but should be flexible enough to handle any category of items Jonathan expresses interest in. The scope is deal-finding rather than general internet research - there's a separate role for broader research activities. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:16-20) (AI)

## Processing Notes

The role name was changed from "Deal Finder" to "Deal Hunter" to be more playful and avoid traditional naming. Purpose was made more inspiring and less formulaic. **Confusion**: Not clear if this role should handle all deal-finding or just specific categories mentioned (like BMW i3s). **Question**: Should there be boundaries on what constitutes a "deal" vs general research? **Ambiguity**: Transcript mentions "things I'm interested in" but doesn't define scope boundaries. **Improvement opportunity**: Consider adding criteria for what makes a deal "good enough" to alert on. **Note**: Filename needs to be updated from `deal-finder.md` to `deal-hunter.md` to match role name.
