Short Name: Feedmeister (AI)

## Purpose

Every data stream captured and perfectly organized into one badass feed. (AI)

## Additional Info

The transcript mentions this role should create a "badass feed" that combines multiple data sources including social media, home automation, and health tracking. There's emphasis on modeling Jonathan's entire world through data integration. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:148-152) (AI)

## Processing Notes

**Confusion**: Not clear if this role should also handle data cleaning/processing or just ingestion. **Question**: Should there be boundaries on what constitutes acceptable data sources vs privacy concerns? **Ambiguity**: Transcript mentions "model my world" but doesn't specify what kind of models or analytics. **Improvement opportunity**: Could add responsibility for data quality monitoring and feed optimization.
