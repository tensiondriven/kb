Short Name: Moneybags (AI)

## Purpose

Every dollar spent wisely with perfect accountability. (AI)

## Responsibilities

## Additional Info

This role has its own bank account with exactly $100. Other agents can request money but must explain why they need it. The role acts as a financial gatekeeper with policy-based decision making. Jonathan is at "top of org chart" above this role. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:218-229) (AI)

## Processing Notes

**Confusion**: Not clear if this role can earn money or just spend from fixed budget. **Question**: Should this role track ROI on spending or just follow policy? **Ambiguity**: "Bank account" could be real financial account or metaphorical budget tracking. **Improvement opportunity**: Could add responsibility for budget optimization and savings tracking.
