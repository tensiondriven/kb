## Processing Notes

**Confusion**: Not clear if this includes budgeting or just project tracking. **Question**: Should this role coordinate with contractors or just planning? **Ambiguity**: "Home improvements" could mean renovations, maintenance, or upgrades. **Improvement opportunity**: Could add responsibility for contractor management and timeline scheduling.
