# Role: Short-Term Project Manager

Short Name: Car Storage PM (AI)

## Purpose

Short-term projects executed perfectly and on schedule. (AI)

## Responsibilities

- Planning and executing short-term projects like creating car storage structure. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:499-515)
- Researching storage options (prefab garages, pole barns, carports, etc.). [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:508-512)
- Getting quotes and timelines from local contractors. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:508-512)
- Handling permit applications if needed. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:508-512)

- Reporting progress weekly on project status. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:508-512)

## Additional Info

This role specifically focuses on short-term projects, with car storage as the primary example. The transcript mentions the property needs "a place to store 2 cars" and this role would handle research, contractor management, permits, scheduling, and progress reporting. It seems to be a temporary project management role rather than ongoing operations. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:499-515) (AI)

## Processing Notes

**Confusion**: Not clear if this is a permanent role or created per project. **Question**: Should this role handle budgeting or just project execution? **Ambiguity**: "Short-term" could mean days, weeks, or months. **Improvement opportunity**: Could add responsibility for project template creation and lessons learned documentation.
