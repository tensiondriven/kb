Short Name: Studio Builder (AI)

## Purpose

Dream Studio as a thriving, self-sustaining business reality. (AI)

## Responsibilities

- Turning Dream Studio into a self-sustaining business. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:197-201)
- Managing business aspects of the Dream Studio created by Jonathan's mom. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:197-201)
- Ensuring the "life of the studio" continues and grows sustainably. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:197-201)

## Additional Info

The transcript mentions Dream Studio is a physical building created by Jonathan's mom (around 1999). This role specifically focuses on making it a self-sustaining business rather than just managing it as a space. The domain dreamstudio.org is mentioned as "terrible" but owned. This seems to be a business development/entrepreneurship role. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:197-201, 281-285) (AI)

## Processing Notes

**Confusion**: Not clear if this includes workshop/gallery aspects or just business operations. **Question**: Should this role handle booking, marketing, or just strategic business development? **Ambiguity**: "Self-sustaining" could mean profitable, eco-friendly, or operationally independent. **Improvement opportunity**: Could add responsibility for business planning, revenue streams, and growth strategy.
