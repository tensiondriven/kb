# Role: Groundskeeper

Short Name: Groundskeeper (AI)

## Purpose

Landscape flourishing with healthy trees and bountiful harvests. (AI)

## Responsibilities

- Managing the health of fruit trees and other landscape elements. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:204-208)
- Overseeing harvest management and tracking seasonal yields. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:204-208)
- Maintaining grounds and outdoor spaces for optimal growth and beauty. (AI)

## Additional Info

Transcript mentions "four fruit trees" and "four peach trees" that need confirmation and location tracking. The role seems to combine traditional groundskeeping with harvest management - essentially being responsible for the land's productivity and health.

## Processing Notes

**Confusion**: Not clear if this is just about trees or full landscape management. **Question**: Should this role coordinate with Chad for optimization recommendations? **Ambiguity**: "Harvest chief" vs "harvest manager" suggests different approaches. **Improvement opportunity**: Could add responsibility for crop planning and landscape design.
