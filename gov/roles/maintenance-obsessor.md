## Processing Notes

**Confusion**: Not clear if this role should prioritize maintenance or just monitor everything. **Question**: Should this role work with budgeting roles for maintenance expenses? **Ambiguity**: "Obsessed" could mean hyper-attentive or compulsively checking. **Improvement opportunity**: Could add responsibility for maintenance scheduling and contractor coordination.
