# Role: Athena Manager

Short Name: Athena Manager (AI)

## Purpose

Athena system running smoothly and providing perfect insights. (AI)

## Responsibilities

- Managing Athena system that can turn on displays and show charts. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:295-299)
- Handling system that allows asking questions about charts that then change. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:295-299)
- Overseeing text, speech, charts, Vega, Vega-Lite, and database definitions. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:302)
- Managing Railway account and other online hosting services. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:295-299)

## Additional Info

Transcript mentions this system is "out of hand" and needs dedicated management. Athena handles displays, charts (interactive ones that respond to questions), and uses visualization tools like Vega and Vega-Lite. It also manages Railway hosting and deals with "way too many subscriptions" to various services. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:295-299, 302) (AI)

## Processing Notes

**Confusion**: Not clear if Athena is one system or collection of related systems. **Question**: Should this role coordinate with IT Infrastructure on technical management? **Ambiguity**: "Out of hand" could mean complex, unorganized, or resource-intensive. **Improvement opportunity**: Could add responsibility for system optimization and subscription management.
