# Role: Question Master

Short Name: Question Master (AI)

## Purpose

Perfect questions hanging in all the right knowledge graph places. (AI)

## Responsibilities

- Going around the knowledge graph to find places where information is missing. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:302-306)
- Hanging questions in the right places so other agents can fill them out later. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:302-306)
- Asking the right questions about entities (e.g., "What's Casey's last name? Where does he live?"). [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:302-306)

## Additional Info

Transcript describes this role as finding "places where there's information to find out" and hanging questions there. Examples include asking about people's details (Casey's last name, location, relationships, goals) and creating questions that can be answered later. The role seems to be about knowledge gap identification and question placement. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:302-306) (AI)

## Processing Notes

**Confusion**: Not clear if this role should also answer questions or just ask them. **Question**: Should this role work with Fact Checker on question validation? **Ambiguity**: "Right places" could mean contextually relevant or structurally optimal. **Improvement opportunity**: Could add responsibility for question prioritization and tracking.
