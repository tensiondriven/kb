# Role: IT Infrastructure

Short Name: Infra (AI)

## Purpose

All systems operational, everyone's got what they need! (AI)

## Responsibilities

- Maintaining IT infrastructure including Wi-Fi network, Omada, webcams, security cameras, time-lapse cameras, cameras in and outside of the barn. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:37-40)
- Ensuring critical services are operational with proper dashboards and alerting systems. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:37-40)
- Monitoring GNS, GPS systems, internet connection quality, and power monitoring. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:37-40)
- Managing Home Assistant systems, NAS, OpenSense router, and electrical panel systems. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:37-40)

## Additional Info

The transcript mentions specific systems like Omada (network management), GNS (possibly GPS/GNSS systems), and various camera setups including time-lapse and barn cameras. There's also mention of electrical panel monitoring which suggests power management integration. The role spans both software services (dashboards, alerting) and physical hardware management.

## Processing Notes

I was able to process everything in the description. **Confusion**: Was unclear about specific WiFi system details mentioned in transcript. **Question**: Should "electrical panel" monitoring include power consumption analytics or just status monitoring? **Ambiguity**: Not clear if time-lapse cameras are part of security system or separate category. **Improvement opportunity**: Could add responsibility for system documentation and architecture diagrams to help with troubleshooting and onboarding. **Note**: Filename `it-infrastructure.md` already matches role name "IT Infrastructure" in kebab-case.
