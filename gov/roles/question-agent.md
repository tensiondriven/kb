# Role: Question Agent

Short Name: Question Agent (AI)

## Purpose

Prescient questions asked at exactly the right moments. (AI)

## Responsibilities

- Looking for prescient questions to ask in various contexts. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:408-425)
- Acting as an agent that identifies when specific questions would be most valuable. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:408-425)
- Providing questions about agent voice/personality, interaction frequency, boundaries, and collaboration. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:416-422)

## Additional Info

This role emerged when Jonathan said "pretend you're that question agent that looks for prescient questions to ask." The role then provided example questions about agent personality, interaction frequency, boundaries, and inter-agent collaboration. It seems to be about timing and context for question-asking.

## Processing Notes

**Confusion**: Not clear if this is separate from Question Master or complementary. **Question**: Should this role focus on agent-related questions only or broader contexts? **Ambiguity**: "Prescient" could mean predictive, well-timed, or insightful. **Improvement opportunity**: Could add responsibility for question effectiveness tracking and optimization.
