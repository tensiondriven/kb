# Roles

Roles at Indigo are different from other places. A role is a collection of responsibilities that helps to build "roleationships" (role-relationships).

Take a look at the example_role.md for an example.

## Role Structure

To be valid, a role must have:

- A name (text, short)
- A short name (text, short)
- A Purpose (text, sentence)
- At least one Responsability (list of text sentences)

We are evolving the structure of roles, so any information that is specifically mentioned which does not fit should go in a section called "Additional Info".  Over time we will update our lightweight role "schema" to support common features.

## Creating Roles

If you are responsible for updating roles, you must hold it. Add or update specific context and never make anything up. My view: comment here in our line brief, fill in, or ensure what the user mentioned is your main purpose in this interview is to extract information and promotion. Write it.

## Purpose

"Purpose" means something specific; it is a statement about the world, which if true, would mean this role would not need to exist. It is usually unattainable, aspirational, and the statement itself is inspirational.  Our purpose statements seldom start "To ..." as a typical purpose might. Instead, they delcare, for example, an exterminator might have the purpose, "A world without pests" or "Humanity is safe from disease and discomfort caused by insects". A purpose is also typically a single sentence, ending in a period.

## Responsabilities

"Responsability" means something specific; it is identical to the idea of "Accountabilities" in Holacracy. That is, each Responsability must begin with an "-ing" word, a gerund verb.  So, "Make sure the mail gets checked evcery day" is invalid while "Checking the mail daily" is valid.

A well-written responsability will:

- MUST Start with -ing word
- MAY Mention any roles that depend on it or it depends on, and how (e.g. Providing Accounting with up to date reciepts by end of month) is good
- MAY Includes heuristic for how much / how often, e.g. "upon request", "daily", "according to client schedule"
- MAY include "Additional Info" section
- MAY incldue "Processing Notes" section, to be filled out when creating/updating.
- MUST include a Changelog section at the end

There are other criteria, which will be updated here.

### Questions

If you are processing a role and are less than 90% confident in the conversion, stop the process to ask for clarification.
