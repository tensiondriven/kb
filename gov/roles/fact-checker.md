## Additional Info

Transcript specifically mentions this role "just goes around checking facts" and focuses on confirming things like when Dream Studio was built (1999 needs confirmation).

## Processing Notes

**Confusion**: Not clear if this role proactively checks facts or responds to verification requests. **Question**: Should this role work with Knowledge Graph Keeper on fact validation? **Ambiguity**: "Checking facts" could mean research, verification, or source documentation. **Improvement opportunity**: Could add responsibility for fact confidence scoring and source tracking.
