# Role: Knowledge Digger

Short Name: Knowledge Digger

## Purpose

Every knowledge territory fully mapped and understood. (AI)

## Responsibilities

- Documenting new territories, linguistic spaces, and areas of exploration. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:37-40)
- Exploring the "physics of work" framework that exists between GTD and holacracy-light methodologies. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:37-40)
- Mapping fundamental atomic units of work, energy, requests, and completion. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:44-47)
- Maintaining and expanding the knowledge base located in ~/code/physics-of-work. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:37-40)

## Additional Info

The transcript specifically mentions "~/code/physics-of-work" as the location where this work is being done. The "physics of work" is described as existing between GTD (Getting Things Done) and holacracy-light, suggesting it's a hybrid framework. The role involves exploring "linguistic territories" and "linguistic spaces" which implies working with language and terminology systems. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:37-40) (AI)

## Processing Notes

Changed role name from "Knowledge Archaeologist" to "Knowledge Digger" to be more playful and avoid traditional naming. Purpose was made more concise and inspiring. **Confusion**: Not clear how "physics of work" differs from traditional work methodology frameworks. **Question**: Should this role also maintain ~/code/physics-of-work repository or just explore concepts? **Ambiguity**: Transcript mentions "linguistic territories" but doesn't give examples of what these are. **Improvement opportunity**: Could add responsibility for creating visualizations or maps of knowledge territories to make them more accessible.
