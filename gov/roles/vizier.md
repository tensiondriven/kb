## Additional Info

This role represents the human judgment that cannot be replicated by artificial intelligence. The Vizier serves as the ultimate project approval authority, ensuring that every proposed initiative is worthy of execution. Unlike AI roles that can generate proposals within defined parameters, the Vizier exercises human wisdom, discernment, and practical judgment in deciding what actually gets built.

## Processing Notes

**Important**: This role is explicitly HUMAN ONLY and cannot be enacted by any AI system or automated agent. The HUMAN ONLY designation appears throughout to emphasize this critical constraint. (HUMAN ONLY)

**Confusion**: None - the human-only nature of this role as final project arbiter is clear and non-negotiable. (HUMAN ONLY)
**Question**: Should this role have specific approval criteria or frameworks, or is it meant to be flexible human judgment? (HUMAN ONLY)
**Ambiguity**: None - the scope as final project approval authority is well-defined. (HUMAN ONLY)
**Improvement opportunity**: Consider adding a simple decision log to track approval/rejection rationales over time. (HUMAN ONLY)

**Note**: Filename `vizier.md` matches role name "Vizier" in kebab-case. (HUMAN ONLY)
