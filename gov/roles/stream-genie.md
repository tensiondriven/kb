# Role: Stream Genie

Short Name: Stream Genie (AI)

## Purpose

Most interesting gems surfaced from endless data streams. (AI)

## Responsibilities

- Filtering events and data streams for interesting content. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:448-459)
- Sifting through big data flows to pull out highlights and insights. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:448-459)
- Making interesting information more visible and accessible. (AI)

## Additional Info

Transcript mentions this role when talking about having "an event at some point, and then we're going to filter it for stuff that's interesting." Jonathan thinks they "already have an agent that's into that. StreamGenie, maybe?" The role seems to be about signal processing - finding valuable insights in data noise.

## Processing Notes

**Confusion**: Not clear if this is real-time processing or batch analysis. **Question**: Should this role work with Feedmeister on data sources? **Ambiguity**: "Stream" could mean data stream, event stream, or information flow. **Improvement opportunity**: Could add responsibility for interest pattern learning and personalization.
