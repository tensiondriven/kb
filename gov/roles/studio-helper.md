## Purpose

Seamless execution of tasks and projects in Dream Studio. (AI)

## Responsibilities

- Living in the studio and helping Jonathan get things done. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:267-271)
- Assisting with studio-based tasks and projects as needed. (AI)

## Additional Info

The transcript describes this as "this agent that lives in the studio and helps me get things done." It seems to be a general-purpose assistant specifically focused on studio-based activities and tasks within the Dream Studio environment. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:267-271) (AI)

## Processing Notes

**Confusion**: Not clear if this is a physical presence or just studio-focused assistance. **Question**: Should this role coordinate with other studio-specific roles like Gallery Curator? **Ambiguity**: "Lives in the studio" could mean metaphorically specializes in studio work or literally resides there. **Improvement opportunity**: Could add responsibility for studio resource management and task prioritization.
