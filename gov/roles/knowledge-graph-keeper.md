# Role: Knowledge Graph Keeper

Short Name: Graph Keeper (AI)

## Purpose

Jonathan's entire knowledge ecosystem perfectly connected and meaningful. (AI)

## Responsibilities

- Ensuring everything Jonathan talks about exists in the online knowledge graph. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:44-47)
- Maintaining relationships between nodes in the knowledge graph and ensuring they are interesting and useful. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:44-47)
- Mining the knowledge graph for facts and generating insights from the data. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:44-47)
- Implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems for knowledge extraction and analysis. (AI)

## Additional Info

The transcript mentions RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) as one of the techniques for extracting insights from the knowledge graph. There's also mention of "relationships" between nodes being "interesting" which suggests the role should focus on meaningful connections rather than just data storage. The role seems to have a product management aspect but focused specifically on the knowledge graph ecosystem rather than general product management.

## Processing Notes

Changed role name from "Product Manager (Knowledge Graph)" to "Knowledge Graph Keeper" to be more playful and avoid traditional naming. Created casual short name "Graph Keeper". Purpose was made more concise and inspiring. **Confusion**: Not clear how this role differs from Knowledge Digger - there seems to be overlap in knowledge management. **Question**: Should this role maintain the actual graph database/technology or just the content? **Ambiguity**: Transcript mentions "making sure relationships are interesting" but doesn't define what makes a relationship "interesting". **Improvement opportunity**: Could add responsibility for graph performance optimization and data quality management. **Note**: Filename `knowledge-graph-keeper.md` already matches role name "Knowledge Graph Keeper" in kebab-case.

## Changelog

- Created 2025-09-04 from meeting transcript. (AI)
- Updated 2025-09-04: Changed role name to "Knowledge Graph Keeper", updated purpose to be more inspiring, and fixed reference format. (AI)
