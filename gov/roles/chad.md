## Processing Notes

**Confusion**: Not clear if this role handles physical optimization only or also system/process optimization. **Question**: Should Chad work with budgeting roles or just suggest optimizations regardless of cost? **Ambiguity**: "Beefier" could mean muscle mass, system performance, or general capability. **Improvement opportunity**: Could add responsibility for tracking optimization results and ROI analysis.
