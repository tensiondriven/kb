# Role: Gallery Curator

Short Name: Gallery Curator (AI)

## Purpose

The soul of the gallery fully expressed in the world. (AI)

## Responsibilities

- Ensuring the soul of the gallery can express itself in the world. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:197-201)
- Curating and managing the gallery's artistic and expressive elements. (AI)
- Supporting the gallery's mission and vision as part of the Dream Studio. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:197-201)

## Additional Info

The transcript mentions this role as representing "the soul of the gallery" that "wants to express itself in the world." The gallery is part of the Dream Studio complex created by Jonathan's mom. This seems to be an artistic/curatorial role focused on expression and presentation rather than just management. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:197-201) (AI)

## Processing Notes

**Confusion**: Not clear if this is a physical gallery (art display) or metaphorical (body of work). **Question**: Should this role coordinate with the Dream Studio Builder role? **Ambiguity**: "Soul" could mean artistic vision, brand identity, or creative essence. **Improvement opportunity**: Could add responsibility for gallery events, exhibitions, or community engagement.
