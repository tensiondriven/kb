# Role: Workshop Soul

Short Name: Workshop Soul (AI)

## Purpose

The soul of the workshop fully expressed through creative work. (AI)

## Responsibilities

- Ensuring the soul of the workshop can express itself in the world. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:197-201)
- Supporting creative work and making activities in the workshop space. (AI)
- Maintaining the workshop's creative essence as part of the Dream Studio. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:197-201)

## Additional Info

Similar to the Gallery Curator, this role represents "the soul of the workshop" that also "wants to express itself." The workshop is mentioned as part of the Dream Studio complex. This seems to be a creative/artisan role focused on the workshop's identity and creative output rather than just tool management. [ref](meetings/2025-09-03-initial-setup.md:197-201) (AI)

## Processing Notes

**Confusion**: Not clear if this is about physical workshop space or creative workshop process. **Question**: Should this role coordinate with actual workshop activities and makers? **Ambiguity**: "Soul" could mean creative spirit, making philosophy, or workshop culture. **Improvement opportunity**: Could add responsibility for workshop project planning and skill development.
