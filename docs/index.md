## About This Wiki

This repository uses a selective publishing model where content in the `published/` directory is automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages at [https://tensiondriven.github.io/kb/](https://tensiondriven.github.io/kb/).

The `published/` directory contains symlinks to content we want to make public, while the main `gov/` and `ops/` directories contain our working files.

## Getting Started

1. All team members and AI agents should contribute to this knowledge base
2. Follow the templates and structures in `gov/` and `ops/` directories
3. Include references to meeting sources whenever possible
4. Update relevant changelogs when making changes

## Recent Updates

Check the [CHANGELOG](gov/CHANGELOG.md) for the latest updates to roles and governance structures.
